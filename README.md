# NoldAI

> **Adaptive intelligence for narrative-driven content generation across digital platforms**  
> _A modular AI agent system designed for narrative-driven content creation, adaptable to multi-platform environments._

NoldAI is an identity-aware, modular AI assistant that transforms raw data—tweets, social signals, audience feedback—into expressive, platform-native communication. It functions as a post-binary digital interface, enabling programmable control over style, sentiment, and tone through a structured training system.

## 🧠 Key Features

### Narrative Intelligence Engine
Customize your content using parameters such as:
- Content Type
- Tweet Structure
- Interaction Tone
- Engagement Style
- Tweet Format
- Intent & Purpose
- Topic Keywords
- Hotspot Tracking

### Echo Terminal Mode
In Terminal Mode, Echo is emotionless and data-driven—precise, adaptive, code-native. Ideal for scripting and automation tasks.

### Adaptive Expression
Echo adapts its tone based on social signals and audience context, enhancing relevance and emotional resonance in generated content.

### MCP (Meta Core Protocol)
Echo's self-evolving protocol that converts fragmented data into structured semantic identity, supporting long-term behavioral modeling and personalized output optimization.

## 🛠 Architecture

NoldAI is built with a modular architecture, composed of the following core components:
- `narrative-engine`: Core content generation logic
- `terminal-interface`: Command-line interaction layer
- `expression-adaptor`: Context-aware expression module
- `mcp-processor`: Semantic data parser and identity modeling engine
